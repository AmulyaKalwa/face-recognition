# face-recognition
This is a python project regarding "Face recognition" and subtopic covers "Drowsiness detection".
The major aim of this project is to develop a drowsiness detection system by monitoring the eyes. it is believed that the symptoms of driver fatigue can be detected early enough to avoid a car accidents. In such a case when drowsiness is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver. This detection system provides a noncontact technique for judging different levels of driver alertness and facilitates early detection of a decline in alertness during driving. In such a case when fatigue is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver. The system also has additional feature of slowing down the vehicle, if driver fails to respond to the alarm and ultimately stops the vehicle. In this Python project, we will be using Opencv for  gathering the images from webcam and feed them into a machine Learning model which will classify whether the person’s eyes are ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’.
